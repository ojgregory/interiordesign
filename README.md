The project will be centred around the development of a mobile application that provides functionality for
interior design room planning, this functionality will encompass two main areas. The first is
the colouring of chosen walls using Computer Vision to identify and colour the walls,
this allows the user to preview the colour of many different paints to help choose a colour
without having to commit by painting the wall.
The second piece of functionality will be the ability to place furniture into a room using Augmented
Reality, both functionalities combined will provide a centralised application that is able to comprehensively
aid in design of pre-existing rooms.

The main problem this project is solving is an improvement upon current solutions, in existing applications the
edge detection algorithms used are unable to distinguish objects from the chosen walls to an appropriate degree
of accuracy; this results in the applications being unsuitable for any serious usage as the colour is regularly applied
to furniture and other objects as well as the chosen wall. To improve this functionality
I will test many available edge detection algorithms to find an algorithm with the appropriate speed and accuracy
to be used on a mobile platform.

The addition of AR functionality will allow users to make more comprehensive decisions
about the rooms design so rather than having to switch between multiple applications to
view changes to a room the user is able to layer the changes within one application.

There will also be functionality to organise taken images and group the furniture
selections into rooms, this will be saved so that the user can come back to their selections
on a per room basis, thus providing whole house planning functionality rather
than using it purely for quick throw away previews of rooms.

Primarily this project will focus on finding the optimal technology to apply to this area
and making use of it in a quick and efficient manner. The first phase
of the project will focus on testing different edge detection algorithms and assessing their suitability.
When an approach is chosen it will be implemented and development of Augmented Reality furniture placement
and room based organisation to the application will be started, beginning with AR functionality.
